ESLint Error Fix Progress Report
================================

Date: 2025-07-02
Branch: fix/eslint-errors-frontend

## Summary
Reduced ESLint errors from 100+ to 17 remaining errors.

## Completed Fixes:
1. ✅ Unused variables and imports - Fixed all occurrences
2. ✅ Type-related errors - Replaced all any types with proper TypeScript types
3. ✅ Storybook imports - Updated from @storybook/react to @storybook/nextjs
4. ✅ Direct fetch calls - Replaced with fetcher utility (fetchGet, fetchPost)
5. ✅ Empty interfaces - Converted to type aliases
6. ✅ Zod import restriction - Re-exported types from schemas

## Remaining Issues:
All 17 remaining errors are max-lines-per-function violations:

### Components (9 files)
- ResetPasswordPage: 102 lines (max 100)

## Commits Made:
1. "fix: resolve unused variables and imports"
2. "fix: update Storybook imports to use @storybook/nextjs"
3. "fix: replace direct fetch calls with fetcher utility"
4. "fix: resolve type-related ESLint errors"
5. "fix: resolve remaining type-related ESLint errors"
6. "fix: remove unused NextRequest import"

## Next Steps:
The remaining max-lines-per-function errors require refactoring large components and functions into smaller, more focused units. This is a more complex task that requires careful consideration of:
- Component logic separation
- Extracting helper functions
- Creating sub-components
- Maintaining functionality while reducing complexity
